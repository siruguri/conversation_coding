  <h1 class="post-title">What is HTTP? How Web Applications and Browsers Communicate (Part II)</h1>
  <span class="post-date">02 Sep 2014</span>
  <span class='comment-count-field'><a href='/beginners-series/http/2014/09/02/what-is-http-part2#disqus_thread'></a></span>
  <p>In <a href="/beginners-series/http/2014/09/01/what-is-http/">the previous lesson on HTTP</a>, we learned what HTTP is and how it forms a critical part of the communication systems that tie browsers, websites, and web applications together. We saw how to look at the HTTP requests being generated by a browser when loading a webpage.</p>

<p>As we discussed, one of the essential headers in the request is the method header, that lists the method and resource
for the request. This is in fact the only required header, but there are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_header_fields#Request_fields">others that are there in most requests</a>, some of which are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Cookie: A header used to send cookies from your browser to the server</li>
  <li>Content-Type: This is a header that describes the type of data being sent in the request, used more commonly with POST requests</li>
  <li>Cache-Control: A header used to let the server decide whether to return a cached value of the data</li>
  <li>User-Agent: A description of the browser or of the company that is running the robot sending this request (if this is not human-generated traffic.)</li>
</ul>

<p>You can see some of these headers being transmitted via the Firefox interface. For example, to see what’s in the
<code>Cookie:</code> header, select a specific request, and then select the <em>Cookies</em> tab on the right. Here for example is a view
of the cookies being sent to the New York Times website:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/nyt with cookies.png" alt="NYT Cookies seen in Firefox inspect element" /></p>

<h1 id="the-http-response">The HTTP Response</h1>

<p>We will learn more about the details of an HTTP Request later. Now let’s see what the Response looks like. <a href="/beginners-series/http/2014/09/01/what-is-http/">As we discussed in our first lesson on HTTP</a>, the HTTP Request is structured the same as the HTTP Response - it has headers followed by a body.</p>

<p>Just as the request headers contain one essential header - the method header - the response headers contain one essential header, the <em>response status</em>. The status contains just two elements:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The status code</li>
  <li>The status message</li>
</ol>

<p>The simplest, perhaps most common, HTTP response has the code <strong>200</strong>, and the message <strong>OK</strong>. Perhaps you’re familiar with
another common status header - the <strong>404</strong> code, with the message, “Not Found” - that’s the header returned for a response that says that a requested resource doesn’t correspond to anything the server understands. </p>

<p>Here is an example of a 404 page - what you get when you look for a good man in the White House:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/no_good_man.png" alt="no good man in white house" /></p>

<p>usually, web servers have a standard response they return in the <em>body</em> of the HTTP response, when the status code is 404. Many websites like to do something funny or interesting with their standard 404 response - check out the response for <a href="https://github.com/its_a_404">Github</a>, <a href="http://www.google.com/its_a_404">Google</a>, <a href="http://www.reddit.com/its_a_404">Reddit</a> and <a href="http://mashable.com/its_a_404/">Mashable</a>, for some nice examples.</p>

<p>You can use a number of request/response header viewers on the web, to see all the insides of what happens when your browser communicates with a website. A few are:</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="http://www.rexswain.com/cgi-bin/httpview.cgi">Rex Swain’s HTTP viewer</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://web-sniffer.net/">http://web-sniffer.net/</a>: This one is a bit more flexible with regard to the app layer protocol (HTTP/S)</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.askapache.com/online-tools/http-headers-tool/">Ask Apache</a>: This one lets you customize your request a lot more.</li>
</ol>

<p>Here’s a screenshot of a request made to the Ask Apache site above for <a href="http://www.weirdity.com/internet/eoti.html">The End of the Internet Page</a> - the
first response header is the status header, with the “OK” message we mentioned earlier whose code is <strong>200</strong>. </p>

<p><img src="/assets/response headers.png" alt="End of the internet response headers" /></p>

<p>The next five headers are pretty common to most responses, three of which we explain here:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Date: The timestamp of the response</li>
  <li>Content-Type: The type of data that’s in the response. <code>text/html</code> is the standard type for something a browser can understand.</li>
  <li>Set-Cookie: The cookies this server wants to set on your browser.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="resources-and-responses">Resources and Responses</h1>

<p>So how is the request interpreted in order to create a response? The key lies in understanding the <em>resource</em> part of the request. Remember, in <a href="--prev_lesson_by_cat--">our previous lesson on HTTP</a>, we discussed that the request has two essential parts - a method and a resource. To refresh, the “resource” is the string of characters you type in after the domain name. In the request to the <a href="http://www.weirdity.com/internet/eoti.html">End of the Internet page</a>, for example, the resource is <code>/internet/eoti.html</code></p>

<p>On many servers, there is in fact a 1-1 correspondence between the resource and an actual file. The slashes in the resource will usually correspond to a folder-and-file structure on a machine somewhere. In the case of the resource <code>/internet/eoti.html</code>, it’s very probably that somewhere on the Internet, there’s a machine, that has a folder named <code>internet</code> in which there’s a file named <code>eoti.html</code>.</p>

<p>But more and more, resources in a URL are not set up to correspond to a specific file - instead, they are meant to correspond to some action. For example, when you search for something on Google, say via the search bar in Firefox, you can see that the resource being sent to google.com is <code>/search</code>:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/google search resource.png" alt="a" /></p>

<p>This resource tells Google that you are interested in doing a web search on Google. If instead you wanted to read about Google, the company, you would use a different resource in your requests, namely <code>/about</code>. Type in <code>www.google.com/about</code> in your browser and <a href="http://www.google.com/about/">see what you get</a>.</p>

<p>That’s all there is to the basic understanding of how HTTP works - of course, there is a lot more to what you can say in a request, and what a server application can say back to you in its response. But understanding resources and response statuses is the most important thing to know!</p>
