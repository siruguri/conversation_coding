title: What is HTTP? How Web Applications and Browsers Communicate (Part II)
categories: beginners-series http
---

In [the previous lesson on HTTP](--prev_post_by_cat--), we learned what HTTP is and how it's part of the communication systems that tie browsers and websites (and web applications) together. We saw how to look at the HTTP requests being generated by a browser when loading a webpage.

As we discussed, one of the essential headers in the request is the method header, that lists the method and resource
for the request. This is in fact the only required header, but there are [others that are there in most requests](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_header_fields#Request_fields), some of which are:

* Cookie: A header used to send cookies from your browser to the server
* Content-Type: This is a header that describes the type of data being sent in the request, used more commonly with POST requests
* Cache-Control: A header used to let the server decide whether to return a cached value of the data
* User-Agent: A description of the browser or of the company that is running the robot sending this request (if this is not human-generated traffic.)

You can see some of these headers being transmitted via the Firefox interface. For example, to see what's in the
`Cookie:` header, select a specific request, and then select the _Cookies_ tab on the right. Here for example is a view
of the cookies being sent to the New York Times website:

# The HTTP Response

We will learn more about the details of an HTTP Request later. Now let's see what the Response looks like. [As we discussed in our first lesson on HTTP](--prev_post_by_cat--), the HTTP Request is structured the same as the HTTP Response - it has headers followed by a body.

Just as the request headers contain one essential header - the method header - the response headers contain one essential header, the _response status_. The status contains just two elements:

1. The status code
1. The status message

The simplest, perhaps most common, HTTP response has the code **200**, and the message **OK**. Perhaps you're familiar with
another common status header - the **404** code, with the message, "Not Found" - that's the header returned for a response that says that a requested resource doesn't correspond to anything the server understands. 

Here is an example of a 404 page - what you get when you look for a good man in the White House:

![no good man in white house]( {{ site_url }}/assets/no_good_man.png)

usually, web servers have a standard response they return in the _body_ of the HTTP response, when the status code is 404. Many websites like to do something funny or interesting with their standard 404 response - check out the response for [Github](https://github.com/its_a_404), [Google](http://www.google.com/its_a_404), [Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/its_a_404) and [Mashable](http://mashable.com/its_a_404/), for some nice examples.

You can use a number of request/response header viewers on the web, to see all the insides of what happens when your browser communicates with a website. A few are:

1. [Rex Swain's HTTP viewer](http://www.rexswain.com/cgi-bin/httpview.cgi)
1. [http://web-sniffer.net/](http://web-sniffer.net/): This one is a bit more flexible with regard to the app layer protocol (HTTP/S)
1. [Ask Apache](http://www.askapache.com/online-tools/http-headers-tool/): This one lets you customize your request a lot more.
