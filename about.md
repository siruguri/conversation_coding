The goal of the Conversational Coding team is to broaden computer literacy. We help beginners find the right level of
understanding they need to get comfortable with learning how online technologies work. As experienced programmers, who
have been at this for many years, we have seen a variety of tools being introduced that make the introductoon to coding
a far gentler one than it used to be. Our lessons help beginners get familiar with these tools, and learn how to use
them as stepping-stones to graduate to a deeper understanding of how computer programs work.

## What We Focus On 

Our main focus is on "dynamic web applications" - something you can make accessible on the Internet for people to use
via their browsers and that stores user data of some sort. We believe that the Ruby on Rails framework is the best way
to be introduced to the various concepts involved. Specifically, our lessons focus on the following topics:

* Setting up your development environment: best practices for Windows and Mac OSX machines.
* Getting familiar with programming: Using Ruby for simple data analysis
* Product and Project Design: What to think about when embarking on any programming project
* The MVC concepts, and how Ruby on Rails provides simple to complex ways of implementing it
* Deploying to production: How web servers and cloud-based services (like Heroku) work

Have questions or suggestions? Feel free to [add to the conversation on GitHub](https://github.com/conversationalcoding/conversationalcoding.github.io/issues/new) or [ask us on Twitter](https://twitter.com/italkcode).

Have fun coding!
