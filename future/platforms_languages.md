## Raw thoughts

When you are coding, you have to think about four things:

* Platforms
* Environments
* Languages
* Libraries

Typically, you are trying to build an application that runs on a certain platform. This is the first aspect you have to familiarize yourself with. It's your first choice on the path to writing your first software application.

The most basic platform is usually some hardware device, or a group of hardware devices. You develop for an IBM machine, or for the Apple iPhone, and so on. You might develop for ATM machines; or for card readers used at grocers store counters.

Most hardware platforms usually come with two things - an **operating system,** and an environment.
